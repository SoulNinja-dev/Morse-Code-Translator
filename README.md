## Inspiration
ive always wondered how people talk in morse, so I decided this was the best time to make an app which can translate English to morse and morse to English! 
## What it does
It inputs english or morse, and translates it to the other and copies it to the clipboard
## How we built it
I built it using python and the module Tkinter for the GUI
## Challenges we ran into
The GUI didn't seem to like White spaces, so that took some time to fix.
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
The project as a whole and the fact that it copies straight away to our clipboard instead of just printing it.
## What we learned
A lot about morse codes, and GUI's and clipboards.
## What's next for Morse Code Translator App | Python, Tkinter
Probably more modes.
